## config
create a file called `config.toml` then, copy the example from [example-config.toml](/example-config.toml) with your information. leave pin blank if you do not have one.

for `description` you can put whatever you want but for where your current robux will be put **%robux%**, check config for example

`update_delay` is in seconds, i recommend times over 10 minutes due to rate limits

## running
**make sure you have python installed. ([python download](https://python.org/download))**

firstly install the requirements.
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
now run main.py like so
```
python main.py
```

`python` in these commands will be python or python3 depending on your os.
